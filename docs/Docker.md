# Dedicated docker repository:

## [Atinoda/text-generation-webui-docker](https://github.com/Atinoda/text-generation-webui-docker)

The project dockerises the deployment of `oobabooga/text-generation-webui`and its variants. It provides a default configuration (corresponding to a vanilla deployment of the application plus pre-installed `PanQiWei/AutoGPTQ` library) as well as pre-configured support for other set-ups (e.g., latest `llama-cpp-python` with GPU offloading, the more recent `triton` and `cuda` branches of GPTQ).
